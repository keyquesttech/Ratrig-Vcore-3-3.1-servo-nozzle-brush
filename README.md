  With the introduction of beacon touch/contact, having a clean nozzle is essential, especially if you plan to use more than three samples. Therefore, a solution to clean the nozzle was needed. However, the Vcore-3/3.1 is tight on space, and the nozzle does not hang over the edge of the bed in any position. As a result, having a servo-mounted brush was necessary. That is why I designed this solution.
