  <strong><h1>Ratrig servo nozzle brush</h1></strong>

  With the introduction of beacon touch/contact, having a clean nozzle is essential, especially if you plan to use more than three samples. Therefore, a solution to clean the nozzle was needed. However, the Vcore-3/3.1 is tight on space, and the nozzle does not hang over the edge of the bed in any position. As a result, having a servo-mounted brush was necessary. That is why I designed this solution.

**Disclaimers:** 
 - The parts were designed to be printed via SLS; however, all parts can be printed via FDM on a standard 3D printer such as a RatRig. Please note that support will be necessary.
 - A 270 degree servo is needed if you plan to mount the servo on the right.

**Parts needed:**

 - Printed parts:
	 - [20kg_servo_mount.stl](https://www.printables.com/model/913748-ratrig-vcore-331-servo-nozzle-brush/files#preview:file-i0pbr) This is the part that holds the servo.
	 - [Brush_holder.stl](https://www.printables.com/model/913748-ratrig-vcore-331-servo-nozzle-brush/files#preview:file-IZfeJ) This is the part that holds the brush
	 - [Arm_Left_servo.stl](https://www.printables.com/model/913748-ratrig-vcore-331-servo-nozzle-brush/files#preview:file-Ac7of) The "left"/"right" in the name indicates where the arm mounts to the servo, so use this file if you plan to mount the servo to the right.
	 - [Arm_Right_servo.stl](https://www.printables.com/model/913748-ratrig-vcore-331-servo-nozzle-brush/files#preview:file-6haNp) The "left"/"right" in the name indicates where the arm mounts to the servo, so use this file if you plan to mount the servo to the left.

 - Electronics:
	 - 1x: [270 degree 20kg servo](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B076CNKQX4?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details)

 - Hardware:
	 - 1x: [Brass brush](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0C786T8Z7?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details) This one is pre cut but you can use any other brass brush and cut it yourself, in fact that may be better since you can cut it to fit perfectly.
